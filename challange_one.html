        <h2>Simple Fixed Pulley</h2>
        <div class="pulley">
            <div>
                <p>A simple pulley is a basic mechanical device used to lift or move loads with less effort. It consists
                    of a wheel with a groove along its edge and a rope, belt, or cable that fits into the groove. The
                    pulley works by changing the direction of the force applied to lift a load, and when combined in
                    systems, it can also multiply the force, making it easier to lift heavier objects.</p>
                <p>There are three main types of pulleys: fixed, movable, and compound. A fixed pulley is attached to a
                    structure, like a ceiling or beam, and does not move. In this setup, the pulley changes the
                    direction of the force applied. For example, if you pull down on the rope, the load goes up.
                    However, a fixed pulley does not reduce the amount of force needed to lift the object—it only makes
                    the task more convenient.</p>
                <p>A movable pulley, on the other hand, is attached directly to the load. In this case, one end of the
                    rope is anchored while the pulley and load move together. When you pull on the rope, the pulley
                    supports part of the load's weight. This setup effectively reduces the amount of force needed to
                    lift the object by half. So if you're lifting a 100 kg object, you only need to exert enough force
                    to lift 50 kg. The trade-off is that you need to pull twice as much rope to lift the object the same
                    height.</p>

        <div class="our_work">
            <div>
                <p>In our case, we tried to make the pulley out of wood, a pipe, a rope, and a jar we used as a bucket.
                    What worked while trying to do the prototype was we were able to make a good structure out of the
                    woods and we even tried to make the wheel out of wood and the pipe that we had, unfortunately, the
                    pipe wasn’t rotating on the wood as we had anticipated but it was still lifting the bucket as
                    planned.</p>

                <div class="electricity">
                    <p>Wind is one of the largest sources of renewable energy. It is used to produce electricity by
                        converting the kinetic energy of air in motion into electricity. In the wind turbines, the
                        onshore and offshore winds rotate the rotor blades, which convert kinetic energy into rotational
                        energy. This rotational energy is transferred by a shaft to the generator, thereby producing
                        electrical energy.</p>
                    <img class="electric" src="images/electricity.webp" alt="">

                <div class="electricity">
                    <p>The amount of power that can be harvested from wind depends on the size of the turbine and the
                        length of its blades. The output is proportional to the dimensions of the rotor and to the cube
                        of the wind speed. Theoretically, when wind speed doubles, the wind power potential increases by
                        a factor of eight.</p>

                        economic advantages since it has a low cost of energy to produce while operating. This helps
                        homeowners and communities reduce utility bills, benefit from tax credits and financial
                        incentives.</p>
